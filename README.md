# Fetch_take_home

I did the data evaluation first so I was able to save rewardsReceiptItemList as its separate table before working on the query.

The Relational Data Model can be found as ERD.jpg.

The structure is saved in fetch.sql, and the query is in Query.sql.

The Data Evaluation is FetchRewards.ipynb and the email/slack message is Comunicate with Stakeholders.docx
